What is Consent?
The University of South Carolina defines consent as“the clear, knowing, and voluntary, agreement to participate in mutually agreed-upon acts Consent can be given by words and/or actions, as long as those words and/or actions create mutually understandable clear permission regarding willingness to engage in (and the conditions of ) the sexual activity” It is the responsibility of each party to determine that the other(s) has consented before engaging in the sexual activity.
The University of South Carolina defines consent as permitting, approving, or agreeing to act under University policy CR 1.00 (Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct). University policy CR 1.00 is available at https://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/cr100.pdf. For consent to take place, the following elements must be present:

Both are clear about their intent to engage in sexual activities and their desire to do so is willing.
Both individuals are fully conscious.
Someone who is incapacitated cannot consent.
Neither individual is impaired by drugs or alcohol to the extent they do not know the who, what, when, where, why, or how of the situation.
Coercion, force, or threat of either cancels consent.
Consent to engage in one form of sexual activity does not provide consent to engage in any other form of sexual activity.
Past consent of sexual activities does not imply future consent.
Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not give consent to engage in sexual activity with someone else
The existence of a prior or current relationship does not, in itself, constitute consent; even in the context of a relationship, there must be real time.
and mutual consent to sexual activity.
Consent can be withdrawn or modified at any time, and sexual contact must cease immediately once consent is withdrawn and clearly communicated.
Consent cannot be inferred from the absence of a “no”.
Consent cannot be inferred from silence, passivity, or lack of verbal or physical resistance. Consent may not be given by an individual who has not reached the legal age of consent under applicable law.

Violence are defined below Additionally, definitions for similar terms and related statutes from the South Carolina Code of Laws are provided for reference Terminology and state law vary from University Policy at times This creates circumstances where DLES may not be able to bring criminal charges against an individual accused of violating University Policy.However,University Policy outlines consequences for the accused perpetrator if they are a member of the University Community, as well as protections for the accuser This process occurs in the presence or absence of criminal charges.

Interpersonal Violence: acts of relationship violence including domestic
violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and harassment.

procedures, this term refers to physical violence, threats of violence against another, threats of violence against individuals close to, pets of, or property belonging to an individual with a connection to a perpetrator as defined by University policy ro state law
Domestic violence is defined by South Carolina state law, S.C. Code Ann. § 16-25-20, as the unlawful causing of “physical harm or injury to a person’s own household member”or the“offer or attempt to cause physical harm or injury to a person’s own household member with apparent present ability in circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril .”A“household member” includes a spouse, a former
spouse, persons who have a child in common, cohabitants involved during a romantic relationship or those who formerly cohabitated during a romantic relationship
Dating Violence: any act of violence or threats of violence committed by a person: 1. who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant; and 2. where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: the length of the relationship; the type of relationship; and the frequency of interaction between the
persons involved in the relationship. Dating violence is not a specific criminal violation in South Carolina. However, the state does prohibit a number of physically violent actions to include Homicide, Manslaughter, and Assault and Battery in multiple degrees, which may be applicable.
Stalking: A course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person under similar circumstances or with similar identities to fear for their own safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress.

Stalking includes the concept of cyber-stalking, a particular form of stalking in which electronic media such as the internet, social networks, blogs, cell phones, texts, or other similar devices or forms of contact are used. South Carolina law, S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-1700, also prohibits stalking which is defined as a “pattern of words, whether verbal written, or electronic, or a pattern” of “two or more acts occurring over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose”that“serves no legitimate purpose and is
intended to cause and does cause a targeted person and would cause a reasonable person in the targeted person’s position to fear”either“(1) death of the person or a member of his family; (2) assault upon the person or a member of his family; (3) bodily injury to the person or a member of his family; (4) criminal sexual contact on the person or a member of his family; (5) kidnapping of the person or a member of his

object or body part that is committed by force, threat, intimidation, or through exploitation of another’s mental or physical condition of which the assailant was aware or should have been aware State law governing such actions is found in S.C. Code Ann. §16-3-600 and §16-3-652 to 655.

No Contact Letters and Restraining Orders
A No Contact Letter is an official University notice from the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity (OSC) restricting two
University students from initiating contact with each other. Requests for No Contact Letters usually come from students, and require that
both students adhere to the notice
A benefit of the No Contact Letter is that if it is violated, OSC may levy sanctions against the offender, removing the burden from the
accuser Violations of a No Contact Letter are violations of the Student Code of Conduct and will be punished by the OSC.
Although a No Contact Letter may be ordered during the hearing process, it is not necessary to have a hearing before one is issued A
student who expresses fear for their safety and the potential for danger if the alleged perpetrator is within geographic proximity should
always apply for a Restraining Order
Any USC student can request a No Contact Letter; however, both involved parties must be USC students The student initiating the
request will meet briefly with a staff member in the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity. During this meeting, the staff
member will review the parameters of the No Contact Letter and provide the student with the letter, explaining its stipulations. Students
are not obligated to tell the staff member why they are requesting a No Contact Letter, as the student may not have decided to report a
violation/crime
Students interested in requesting a No Contact Letter may contact the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity at 803-777-
4333. SAVIP and DLES are also available to help facilitate this process.
Beyond a No Contact Letter, a student may obtain a Restraining Order from a court of law to get protection from someone who is harass-ing or stalking them. A Restraining Order is a civil order and does not appear on a person’s criminal record. However, if the accused violates
the Restraining Order, they can be arrested. A Restraining Order can be granted for up to one year.
The University cannot issue a Restraining Order, only a No Contact Letter To obtain a Restraining Order, an individual must complete
a Complaint and Motion for Restraining Order and submit it to the Magistrate’s Office in the county where the victim lives or where the
harassment/stalking has taken place The SAVIP Office and DLES are available to help assist with the application process and provide support for students who pursue this option.
Notification of Outcomes is that the  The alleged student accused and the alleged victim are notified simultaneously at the OSC hearing and in writing of the outcome of the proceeding.

Appeals
Both an accused student and alleged victim may appeal the outcome of the OSC hearing. If one student submits an appeal, the other
student in the OSC case will be notified The other student will have five University business days to submit an appeal if he/she chooses
After the five days, the appeal(s) will be sent to the Vice President of Student Affairs and Academic Support for consideration at which time
all appeal opportunities are closed
Hearing outcomes from the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity or designee (including the Carolina Judicial Council) that
meet the criteria for appeal must be submitted via an appeal form within five University business days from the date the decision letter is
received The OSC will forward it with a response memorandum to the Vice President of Student Affairs
An appeal may be made for one or both of the following reasons:
• A procedural error was committed that has significantly prejudiced the findings of the Hearing Council;

OR
• New evidence that could not have been available at the time of the hearing and would have a significant effect on
the outcome of the case becomes available
Decisions not appealed within five University business days are final. Both the charged student and accuser will be notified simultaneously
and in writing of the outcome of the appeal or any changes to the decision or withdrawal of an appeal by either party.

Guidelines for Assistance for Sexual Assault Victims
If you or someone you know is sexually assaulted:
• Get to a safe place as soon as you can, and call 911 to contact emergency services if needed or to call an
ambulance if you believe you may be seriously injured; you may call SAVIP (24/7) at (803)777-8248 to receive sup-
port and discuss options for immediate care and for reporting, if that is what the survivor wishes. A SAVIP advocate
can provide accompaniment to the hospital if that is what the survivor wants
• Try to preserve physical evidence. Do not wash, use the toilet, or change clothing if you can avoid it. If you do
change clothes, put all clothes you were wearing at the time of the assault in a paper, not plastic bag
• Get medical attention as soon as possible to make sure you are physically well and to permit collection of import-
ant evidence in the event you may later wish to take legal action.
• Contact a law enforcement agency to report the assault
• Talk with an advocate or counselor who will maintain confidentiality, help explain your options, give you informa-
tion, and provide emotional support
• Contact someone you trust for initial and ongoing support
If an individual does not want to file a criminal complaint with DLES, they may still seek restorative justice by filing a complaint directly
with the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX and inquiring with SAVIP about their options. Help and support are always available through
SAVIP, Counseling and Psychiatry services, and other community resources
Sexual Assault, Relationship, and Dating Violence Programs
The University of South Carolina prohibits dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking To raise awareness of those issues
and to assist survivors of such violence, the University offers a number of resources to the campus community
The University utilizes a website to inform the campus community of issues involving interpersonal violence, including sexual assault The
websitewww.sc.edu/interpersonalviolenceisaone-stopdestinationforinterpersonalviolenceresources,toincludeinterpersonalviolencet
prevention and education programs and resources for survivors
One of the primary University support units dealing with all forms of interpersonal violence is Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention
& Prevention (SAVIP). SAVIP is located in the Thomson Building. Its advocates offer support and services to students, faculty, and staff
whoaresurvivorsofinterpersonal violence which includes sexual assault, attempted sexual assault, relationship/dating violence, domestic
violence, stalking, and/or harassment
SAVIP provides educational programming and training throughout the year (see below for a list of programs and trainings). SAVIP also
coordinates annual campus-wide campaigns to raise awareness and promote prevention of interpersonal violence Notable campaigns
include Relationship Violence Awareness in October, Stalking Awareness in January, and Sexual Assault Awareness in April
SAVIP recognizes Relationship Violence Awareness Month (RVAM) with events designed to increase awareness about intimate partner
violenceasamajorsocialissue.RVAMeventsincludetablingandeducationalsessionsdesignedtoraiseawarenessofdatingandrelationship
violence, how to recognize warning signs, as well as how to foster healthy relationships, and how to find services for those impacted by
relationship violence

promoting a culture of healing and accountability. SAAM events encourage members of the University Community to utilize bystander
intervention methods to prevent sexual assault and other forms of interpersonal violence Through education, campaigns, and bystander
accountability, SAVIP actively seeks to foster a Carolina community of respect, trust, equality, and healthy relationships

Gamecocks Stand Up – Bystander Intervention Program
SAVIP promotes bystander accountability through Gamecocks Stand Up, bystander intervention education that includes four bystander
intervention strategies and resources on and off-campus for those involved in harmful or negative situations
The scope of Gamecocks Stand Up is diverse, offering informational material, training for students, faculty, and staff, classroom presenta-
tions, and outreach events.
A “bystander” is a person who observes a situation or event but is not directly involved in it. For example, if you’re walking down the
sidewalk and see two cars collide but you don’t get involved you are a bystander to the event. At the other end of the spectrum are“active
bystanders”These are people who notice a harmful situation is about to happen, is currently happening or has already happened, and then
they make a conscious decision to step in and intervene. In the previous scenario, an active bystander would see the collision but stop to call
USCPD and report the incident
Changing Carolina Peers Leaders
Changing Carolina Peer Leaders (CCPL) program is a student-run organization that works to educate, advocate for, and engage with peers
by connecting students to on-campus resources. Students work toward inclusive and diverse programs on sexual health, healthy relation-
ships, mental health, and general wellness to promote health equity for all members of the campus community.
